"""
Intern method within the class
Extern method outside the class
Sometimes in the extern method the information is sensitive and not to be shown. 
To create a private attribute: __
However as shown below, we can still see private information and that is a Python's downside and
we should be carefull with it. 
Mingling - In Python, mangling is used for class attributes that one does not want subclasses 
to use which are designated as such by giving them a name with two leading underscores and 
no more than one trailing underscore.
